        <p class="infosIrlanda">Ireland is a sovereign state in Europe that occupies about five-sixths of the island of the same name. It is a constitutional republic governed as a parliamentary democracy, with a president elected to serve as head of state. Considered a developed country, Ireland has the third highest Human Development Index (HDI) in the world, in addition to excellent rankings in indices that measure the degree of democracy and freedoms such as press, economic and political freedom.</p>
        <p class="infosIrlanda">Ireland has two official languages, Irish and English. Even though only 2% of the population has Irish as their main language (this small portion of individuals is located in Galway), schools have a compulsory language teaching and most people in the country have a basic understanding of it. Furthermore, the National Anthem of Ireland is entirely in Irish.</p>
        <p class="infosIrlanda">Ireland is a country that does not stand out in the gastronomic world. Well, cooking has a certain simplicity both in the preparation, in the amount of ingredients, and in the final dish. The main ingredient of this cuisine is the potato, which is in most Irish dishes. The great love for potatoes comes from "<a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Fome_de_1315%E2%80%931317" class="linksTextos" target="_blank">great hunger</a> ", which took place in 1840. Some typical Irish dishes are: <abbr title="Used as breakfast, this meal can be taken with tea, milk, coffee, or even orange juice">Irish Breakfast</ abbr>, <abbr title="It is a traditional Irish dish consisting of layers of sausages, bacon, potatoes and onions that are perfectly sautéed in broth">Dublin Coddle</abbr>, <abbr title="It is the most common stew from Ireland, made with meat and vegetables such as potatoes and carrots">Irish Stew</abbr>, <abbr title="Consists of ground lamb covered in mashed potatoes">Shepherd's Pie</abbr>, <abbr title= "It consists of breaded and fried fish with fries. It is commonly served with some sauce, such as mayonnaise, ketchup or a puree of peas.">Fish and Chips</abbr>.</p>
        <p class="infosIrlanda">As in much of Europe, the currency in Ireland is the euro. In Ireland, most purchases are made using a debit card rather than a credit card and there is rarely an option to pay in installments. Another interesting fact is that only coins are accepted on buses.</p>
