            <h3>Blarney Castle</h3>
            <p>One of Ireland's landmarks that preserves a history of hundreds of years is in County Cork and is also one of the most visited places in the country. Considered a treasure in Ireland, Blarney Castle itself is a landmark, but a visit to the castle is made even more interesting by the attractions it carries with it.</p>
            <p>Blarney Castle that can be seen today is the third building, the first being built in the 10th century on a wooden structure. Around 1210 AD, it was replaced by a stone one, but later demolished. Only in 1446, the third castle, with some parts still remaining in the original shape to this day, was built by Dermot McCarthy, King of Munster. When visiting the castle, it is possible to see it from various angles to get an idea of its various “interpretations”. That's because, from certain points of view, the castle appears to be more magical. From others, more warrior and medieval; of others, taller, imposing. That is, it all depends on where you look at it. From the top of the castle, it is possible to contemplate wonderful views of more than 60 hectares of extensive parks that include gardens, avenues, shrubs and canals.</p>
